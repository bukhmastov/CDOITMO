/**
 * App has multiple threads, but performs tasks consistently task by task.
 * All code-managed app threads divided to 4 groups:
 * 1. Main thread (UI)
 *    Should contain only tasks, that going to update user interface.
 *    All tasks performed consistently at one looper thread.
 * 2. Background thread, that important for UI (FOREGROUND)
 *    Should contain tasks, that preparing data for user interface.
 *    All tasks performed consistently at one looper thread.
 * 3. Background thread, that not important for UI (BACKGROUND)
 *    Should contain tasks, that not really important for user interface. Purpose of this group
 *    is to create second background queue, that not blocking tasks, that important for UI.
 *    All tasks performed consistently at one looper thread.
 * 4. Standalone thread, that do heavy work (STANDALONE)
 *    Tasks, that do heavy work and not required to be in queue.
 *    Tasks cannot know which state the application will be at the end of the task.
 *    Each task performed at standalone thread.
